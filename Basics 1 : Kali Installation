Download a kali linux iso image

The only official source of Kali Linux ISO images is the Downloads section of the Kali website. Due
to its popularity, numerous sites offer Kali images for download, but they should not be considered
trustworthy and indeed may be infected with malware or otherwise cause irreparable damage to
your system.

âž¨ https://www.kali.org/downloads/
The website is available over HTTPS, making it difficult to impersonate.

What to download? Is My CPU is 32 bit or 64 bit? 
In Windows OS you can find this information by running System Information application.
A 64-bit cpu can also run 32-bit iso of any application, but vise versa is not possible.


Verifying Integrity and Authenticity

Relying on the TLS-protected Website, 
When you retrieve the checksum from the TLS-protected download webpage, its origin is indi-
rectly guaranteed by the X.509 certificate security model: the content you see comes from a web
site that is effectively under the control of the person who requested the TLS certificate.
Now you should generate the checksum of your downloaded image and ensure that it matches
what you recorded from the Kali website:

$ sha256sum kali-linux-2017.1-amd64.iso
49b1c5769b909220060dc4c0e11ae09d97a270a80d259e05773101df62e11e9d kali-linux-2016.2-amd64.is


Using  live kali linux without installing it in the system,
we can do that just by makign a bootable usb, having minimum 8GB, storage.

We can use the tools like Rufus and other if you are using Windows Os, 
and for linux we can use Disk Utilit application, or we can use terminal,

first we have to know the mount point of our Usb stick, use commond 
lsblk  (to get the disk and partitions mount point).

Normally all External media is mount at "/dev/sdb".

After Known the location of our usb, we just have to copy the iso image to it,
for that, we use the commond,

# dd if=<location of the iso image> of=<location ot the usb>

if stands for "input file" and of stands for "output file"
The dd commond reads from the input file and write it back to out put file.

dd commond does not alway show any progress information so you must be patient while it is doing its woek.
